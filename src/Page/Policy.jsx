However, if you are already a Sea Wave Logistics customer contact or you contact Sea Wave Logistics using certain online contact forms in the Logistics content area, your email address is added to the cookie to create an individual profile of your online activities. These same contact forms also provide you with an option to sign up for email marketing updates. By giving your permission, this also allows us to provide you with personalized content, offers or promotions that may interest you. Should you choose not to sign up for email marketing updates, you will not be contacted in the future and your email address will only be used confidentially by Sea Wave Logistics internally to understand your individual online activities. This means that we can still continue to deliver new and improved website content to suit your specific needs. You can learn more about the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Tracking cookie in the Sea Wave Logistics list of Cookies below. Alternatively, to opt out of being tracked by Salesforce Marketing Cloud across all websites (or to reverse your setting if you have previously opted out), you can do so under 'How to Manage Cookies' below.`,
